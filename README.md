# discord-py-skeleton
A discord.py skeleton repository for making discord.py bots. 

## Features
Basic features such as logging and cogs currently exist, this will be expanded in future releases

## How to install
I am under the assumption you have your bot's token at hand and have already created a bot (without all the code).
1. To get started, `pip install` the following requirements (or make sure they are already installed).
   - discord
   - colorama
   - asyncio
2. enter any code you want (familiarise yourself with the README in /application/cogs to make commands and cogs)
3. enter your discord bot token into the `config.json` file, along with your desired prefix
4. enter the root directory in your command prompt and type `python3 bot.py`
